## About
My very first React project, built within my first month of learning both JavaScript and React. This was another entry to a Zero to Mastery Coding challenge, where the aim was to take the template provided by Creative Tim and IBM's Watson Speech recognition and create a project of our choosing. Considering how new to React and JavaScript in general I was, I was very impressed at how this project turned out. I have been considering to revisiting this project now I know a little more.
