## About
This was a very interesting  and intense project. The idea was conceived quite late, so proved quite the challenge to get this ready for potentially a large userbase in time for the Advent of Code. The idea was to allow students to submit their solutions to each AoC challenge in the Zero To Mastery Discord server, where a Discord bot would collect the relevant data and record it in a MongoDB and act as an API for the front end website. 

We then took the original website and created a submission listing, with sort/filter functionality and a leaderboard.
